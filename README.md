PocketMark is a text editor for android with clean and pleasant looking UI, Specially designed for markdown files but able to read almost any text format, all files created with PocketMark are readable by other text editor software and are saved in publicly accessible folder so that you can sync them with other services as well.

✨​ PocketMark's goal is to redefine markdown apps, traditionally known for their barebones UI, by offering a more visually appealing and intuitive experience. On the main page, notes are organized in a dynamic grid format, ensuring an organized and fluid interface. The grid dynamically adjusts itself when a note is deleted or a new one is created/modified. By default, the most recently modified note occupies the top position, although users can change this and order the notes by alphabetical order in the settings.



🎨 Notes can have a color assigned to them to better keep track of them and search them easily.

🖋️ The editor is designed to maximize screen space for the user. The side toolbar remains collapsed when not in use, but it can be easily accessed either by sliding it open or by clicking the icon located in the right corner. (or you can just type the markdown syntax without using it). Pressing the eye icon will switch between viewing the formatted text and the editor with a nice little animation.

💡 PocketMark supports the complete Markdown syntax (including images, gif and tables), which is highlighted for clarity as it's being written in the editor.

📨 Notes are easily shareble with just couple of taps in 3 format:

- Plain text
- MarkDown file
- Image (while not ideal for lengthy files, it's perfect for shorter ones)

🔍​ On the homepage, you can conveniently search for notes using keywords presents in the title or body. Additionally, you can search based on the color assigned to the note, or combine both criteria for a more refined search experience.
